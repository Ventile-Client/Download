I dont suggest downloading anything from this page, besides the installer, and I highly suggest using the it as it does everything for you!
    
The discord has the latest updates, the installer and a great community too!

## Without Installer

* Go to `C:\` drive in file explorer
* Create a folder named `temp`
* Create a folder named `VentileClient` inside there.
* Place the `Ventile-Updater.exe` in the `VentileClient` folder
* Inside `VentileClient` create a folder named `Launcher`
* Extract `VentileClient.zip` into the `Launcher` folder
* Delete `VentileClient.zip`
* Run `VentileClient.exe or the shortcut on your desktop`
* Enjoy!

## NOTES
 
 - If you run into any errors, open an issue or report it in our discord server
 - It does take a bit to open the launcher the first time you install
 - Do not open the installer twice, as this MAY cause an error
